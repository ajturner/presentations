              While we work closely with users to understand their needs, we can't address every specific feature. Each community of user: government, military, NGO, urban planning, journalists, and so on each have their own methods, requirements, and integration. And in particular users need tools that speak their language and allow them to work in their domain without having to learn complex and esoteric technical terminology.

              Anyone who is a software developer, or even has written a small script, has felt the exhileration of expressing a tedious and complex task where the computer seemed to magically do all the work. In cyberspace anything is possible and we have now have amazing tools to quickly implement and push our applications to millions of users.

                Many of grew up playing with and exploring Lego. We probably received some fascinating Pirate Ship, Airplane, or other kit of a well-designed Lego structure. We built it once and admired it but likely we soon took it apart and starting mixing and matching the pieces together. Lego provided us the medium to explore new concepts and quickly try them out. Sometimes I would leave individual creations together for years - pulling them out, admiring and slightly modifying them. They would become components of larger constructions that then were disassembled.
                
                Lego gives us a well engineered, stable, and *fun* platform that we can freely mix and match.

              particularly with Web applications and "HTML5", anyone can look at your code.
              
              It's a good argument this is why Javascript is now so popular. Along the path of HTML, DHTML, AJAX, HTML5 as a technical community we've been looking at each other's Lego creations. Seeing how they're built, inspired to recreate or extend an idea.

               This doesn't work if we're just publishing. We've done Resource centers and code examples. This time it is different. Open collaboration is a different mindset and methodology - and it's permeating how Esri operates in the public and internally.

            <aside class="notes">
              It's an opportunity to work together. Technology reduces the friction of communication and creation. What we need now is the community to more easily share our ideas.

            <aside class="notes">
              Eric Raymond's famous essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" posited a new paradigm where the old ways of building things were going away in favor of more ad-hoc, and collaborative, creation. I think it's a hybrid. The cathedral acts as inspiration, gathering, structure, and sanctity. The bazaar offers unique communication and self-organization.
